# Task Management API

This is a Spring Boot RESTful API for managing tasks. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The API supports features like validation, pagination, and custom error handling.

## Features

- **Create**: Add a new task with details like name, description, priority, deadline, and completion status.
- **Read**:
  - Retrieve all tasks with pagination support.
  - Get tasks by specific attributes such as ID, priority, or deadline.
- **Update**: Modify the details of an existing task.
- **Delete**: Remove a task by its ID.
- **Validation**: Ensures all input data meets the required constraints.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for common issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Hibernate/JPA**: ORM for database interaction.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing.
- **cURL**: Command-line tool for testing the API.

```

### Get All Tasks
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

### Get Task by ID
```bash
